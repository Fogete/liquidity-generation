# Token

This repository contains contracts that relate to the creation, distribution, and governance of an ERC20 token.

The LGE is an innovative mechanism that enables fair participation and direct, efficient initial liquidity generation for decentralized projects.

Users who deposit FTM into the LGE contract at any time during the LGE will be apportioned a proportional share of the LGE regular allocation at the end. This allocation is distributed to all users who deposit during the event.

As an additional incentive, users who deposit during the first day of the LGE will be apportioned a proportional share of the LGE bonus allocation. This allocation is distributed to users who deposit within the first day.

Claimable tokens will be based on share of total deposits at the end of the bonus period, and at the end of the LGE. There is no front-running and being first or last to deposit for either distribution doesnâ€™t matter.
After the LGE ends, a portion of the total supply will be claimable by users who participate in the event.

Full vesting of token claimed through the LGE will occur in one year, modelled through a vesting curve.
